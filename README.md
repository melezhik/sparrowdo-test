# SYNOPSIS

A collection of sparrowdo scenarios.

# Prerequisites

I am running these examples on vagrant/Ubuntu 15.04. Running on other platforms will probably require amending some sparrowfile or even changing
sparrow plugins itself, anyway let me know if you have any issues and I try to help you ASAP.

# USAGE

    $ git clone https://github.com/melezhik/sparrowdo-test
    $ cd sparrowdo-test/example-dir/
    $ sparrowdo --ssh_user=vagrant  --ssh_port=2200 --host=127.0.0.1 # or something like that )))
